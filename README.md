# aengine2
This is the second version of my ASCII engine.

## Past
This engine will replace my old ASCIIgameengine for 2d graphics in the console.

## What do I do?
This library provides a simple interface for drawing console graphics using a stored
framebuffer of text.

## Future
I may come back to this library in the future to add more features, if I tend to use
this a lot.
